# Data-Analysis-and-Data-Visualisation-Basics-Challenge
I am creating a notebook which contains most fundamental things that are necessary to every Data Scientist 



Day 1: I studied that the most important part of the Data Analysis is gathering the data, Going over the data, Cleaning the data
       and restructuring the data, this whole process is called Pre-processing.  
       This can be done using Pandas python library. 
       I have added Pandas basics part1.ipynb which briefly goes through some of the building blocks of Data Analysis.
